#### Transformer Design for a HVDC Transmission System:

In a HVDC transmission system, DC/AC + Transformer + AC/DC system is used to step-up the DC voltage to several kV for long range transmission. Here are some links to ger you familiar with HVDC Transformers:

- [HVDC Transformes](http://www.electrical-knowhow.com/2012/01/hvdc-transformers.html)
-[Siemens Transformer](http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/transformers/subcommittees/hvdc/F10-DrMarioSchenk-Handout.pdf)
-[ABB Transformer](http://new.abb.com/products/transformers/power/hvdc-converter)

The specs of the transformer that you are going to design are as follows:
 
- 6.5 MVA, Single Phase transformer
- Operating Frequency: 500 Hz
- Input Voltage: 3 kV
- Output Voltage: 300kV
- Operating Temperature 110 Â°C
