#### C- Eddy Current Brake Design

In this project you are supposed to design an eddy current brake design which will be used as a mechanical damper. Here are some links on the eddy current brakes:

- [Eddy Current Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu1uRvErM80)
- [Eddy Current Brake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current_brake)
- [Eddy Current Brakes](http://www.explainthatstuff.com/eddy-current-brakes.html)
- [Design of Eddy Current Brakes](http://www.tcsme.org/Papers/Vol35/Vol35No1Paper2.pdf)

The eddy current brake has the following specs:

- Outer diameter smaller than 50 mm
- Axial Length shorther than 25 mm
- Required Force: 3 Nm at 1620 rpm
- Required Force: 1 Nm at 900 rpm

You don't have to, but I strongly advise you to use a FEA software (some options are listed above) for this project.
