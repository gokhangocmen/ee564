*Preliminary design on sheet*
iphyton will be learned and the total design will be installed laterly.

Project-1 :
The specs of the transformer are as follows:
⦁	Single Phase, High Frequency High Voltage Transformer
⦁	Primary Winding Voltage ± 417 V (peak to peak 834 V for pulsing)
⦁	Secondary Winding Voltage ± 12.5 kV (peak to peak 25 kV for pulsing)
⦁	Rated Power 30 kW (for maximum 100 millisecond)
⦁	Switching Frequency Minimum 100 kHz
⦁	Ambient Temperature 0-40 °C

Step 1) choosing of core material
Depending on switching frequency which is at least 100kHz, "Ferrite Core" is suitable for application.
This is because of the fact that "Relative Core Loss" of ferrite is low other than of powdered cores,laminations iron&silicon steel.
My referrence is the notes on EE361.

Step 2) choosing of operating Flux Density depending on determined material
Commonly, manganese-zinc ferrites are used. These ferrites offers very low coercivity, that means the material's magnetization can easily reverse direction without dissipating much energy (hysteresis losses), even they do not need core lamination to reduce “Eddy Current” losses as the Powder core itself offers High resistance.

Choose Bmax = 0.35T, Bsat = 0.5T is the determination for ferrite core.

Step 3) choosing of N.A product
