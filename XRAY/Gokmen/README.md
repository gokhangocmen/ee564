#### Transformer Design for a X-Ray Device:

You are supposed to design a high-frequency, high-voltage transformer that will be used in a X-Ray device. Here are some links to get you familiar with the topic:

- [X-Ray Equipment](http://whs.wsd.wednet.edu/faculty/busse/mathhomepage/busseclasses/radiationphysics/lecturenotes/chapter5/chapter5.html)

The specs of the transformer are as follows:

- Single Phase, High Frequency High Voltage Transformer
- Primary Winding Voltage ± 417 V (peak to peak 834 V for pulsing) 
- Secondary Winding Voltage ± 12.5 kV (peak to peak 25 kV for pulsing) 
- Rated Power 30 kW (for maximum 100 milisecond) 
- Switching Frequency Minimum 100 kHz 
- Ambient Temperature 0-40 °C
